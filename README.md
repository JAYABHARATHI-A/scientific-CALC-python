This project is intended to provide an “Scientific Calculator” which is  GUI based & it mainly focuses on increasing the efficiency of the traditional calculators which could not perform some of the functionalities.
 
For instance, Even in today’s advanced calculators,  We cannot visualize the graphs or the functions we need.
 
Though there are separate applications available for visualizing graphs, separate applications for integration and differentiation operations, we are trying to provide a python based application which will have the capability to perform all the operations under one umbrella.
